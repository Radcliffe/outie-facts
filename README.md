# Outie Facts

This is a "vibe coding" experiment inspired by the Wellness Center scenes
in the show "Severance". The code was initially generated by Claude AI, 
and subsequently modified.

The premise of the show is that a large and sinister pharmaceutical 
company named Lumon Industries has developed a procedure called "severance"
that splits a person's memories and perceptions in two. 
While at work, a severed worker has no memory or knowledge of their life outside 
of work, and vice versa. The work personality is called the "Innie", 
and the personality that exists outside of work is called the "Outie."

Miss Casey is a wellness counselor at Lumon Industries, and she has
undergone severance. She counsels her fellow Innie workers by reciting
bland affirmations and facts about their Outie personalities.

## Credits

It is my opinion that generative AI models are incapable of creating
anything that is genuinely original. The code that was generated by AI
is a mashup of code written by unknown human authors, who I am unable
to credit. Since this is a frivolous personal project with no commercial
value, I won't lose any sleep over it.

All modifications to the initial commit were made by David Radcliffe.
